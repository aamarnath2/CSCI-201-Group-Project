CourseMash is a web-based application that allows classmates to ask questions to one another and collaborate through a forum-like platform. Students can post comments and reply to others' posts in order to engage in collaborative discussion.
Everything we documented works (log in, sign up, add classes, create posts, etc.)
The only thing we weren't able to implement, but documented that we weren't implementing anymore, as the file uploading. This process was a bit more difficult than we anticipated and the amount of work outside of file uploading was a decent amount of work.
