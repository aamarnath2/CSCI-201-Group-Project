CourseMash is a web-based application that allows classmates to ask questions to one another and collaborate through a forum-like platform. Students can post comments and reply to others' posts in order to engage in collaborative discussion.

Member users are able to select from a list of USC classes and are able to add to their course list. They then have access to all the class pages, where they are able to view all post information and also have the ability to add their own comments and reply to others' posts.

Guest users are able to look at a list of all USC classes and look at the titles of all the posts within a class's page; however, they would be unable to actually view a post and thus, will be encouraged to create a member account.

Everything we documented works (log in, sign up, add classes, create posts, etc.)
The only thing we weren't able to implement, but documented that we weren't implementing anymore, as the file uploading. This process was a bit more difficult than we anticipated and the amount of work outside of file uploading was a decent amount of work.
